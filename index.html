              Natural gas is considered to be among the greatest discoveries of mankind. Indeed, it has proven to be fundamentally useful over the years, for example it is used in industries as a fuel for process heating, powering systems, production of chemicals,fertilisers and hydrogen.It is also used in generation of electricity, used for cooking in form of liquefied petroleum gas also known as LPG and many others.

                Despite its numerous uses, natural gas has proven to be quite
                hazardous. Gas leakages may not be very common but they pose a significant threat. If tiny
                amounts of gas are left to collect in an area, an explosion is mostly likely bound to occur.
                Additionally, when people are exposed to large amounts of gas, they may suffer illness or
                suffocation that can lead to untimely death. Lastly, while natural gas doesnâ€™t emit the same
                amount of greenhouse gases as other fossil fuels, it releases carbon dioxide that is a
                greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming.

            <p class="text">To use the gas Leakage Dector, place it in a preferred room especially where gas containers are kept. Install the gas free app onto your mobile device. At first launch, one will be required to enter their personal details especially the device Id that comes with the gas detector. Otherwise if the user already has an account, they can just login and will be redirected to home page.</p>
            <p class="text">The home page has a circular bar showing current gas concentration in the atmosphere or room where the gas leakage detector has been placed.</p>
